    "This project centres around research led by Frank Wood from the Computer Science department at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The research team is investigating player behaviour by collecting detailed data from a MineCraft server that they have set up for this purpose. As players navigate through this world, their actions are recorded and used for their research. However, managing this project comes with its challenges, the team is currently looking for a way to target recruitment efforts effectively to ensure that they have enough resources to accommodate the player base. The aim of this project is to use the **player.csv** and the **sessions.csv** dataset provided by the research team to create predictions that can optimise the study’s recruitment efforts. \n",

    "In total, there are 196 observations in the dataset, as well as 7 variables.\n",
    "The variables in the dataset are:\n",
    "- `experience` *(character)* : Player’s self-reported gaming experience. (Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, Pro)\n",
    "- `subscribe` *(logical)* : Whether the player has subscribed to updates. (TRUE/FALSE)\n",
    "- `hashedEmail` *(character)* : Hashed emails of the players.\n",
    "- `played_hours` *(double)* : Total hours spent on the Minecraft server.\n",
    "- `name` *(character)* : Player's name.\n",
    "- `gender` *(character)* : Self-reported gender of the player. (Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say, Two-Spirited, Agender, Other)\n",
    "- `Age` *(double)* : Player’s age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary statistics in the dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data | Mean | Minimum | Maximum|\n",
    "| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n",
    "| played_hours | 5.845918 | 0 hours | 223.1 hours|\n",
    "| Age | 20.52062 | 8 years | 50 years |\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Values** : Some columns have NA values.\n",
    "- **Outliers** : Extreme values could skew analysis.\n",
    "- **Potential Data Bias** : The sample may not fully represent the broader gaming community.\n",
    "- **Small dataset size** : May lead to overfitting due to only having 196 data points."
