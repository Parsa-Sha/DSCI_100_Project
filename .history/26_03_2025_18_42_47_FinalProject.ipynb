    "This project aims to use the player.csv dataset from a research group on a MineCraft server to create predictions that can optimise the study’s recruitment efforts.\n",

    "In total, there are 196 observations in the dataset, as well as 7 variables.\n",
    "The variables in the dataset are:\n",
    "- `experience` *(character)* : Player’s self-reported gaming experience. (Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, Pro)\n",
    "- `subscribe` *(logical)* : Whether the player has subscribed to updates. (TRUE/FALSE)\n",
    "- `hashedEmail` *(character)* : Hashed emails of the players.\n",
    "- `played_hours` *(double)* : Total hours spent on the Minecraft server.\n",
    "- `name` *(character)* : Player's name.\n",
    "- `gender` *(character)* : Self-reported gender of the player. (Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say, Two-Spirited, Agender, Other)\n",
    "- `Age` *(double)* : Player’s age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary statistics in the dataset are:\n",

    "| Data | Mean | Minimum | Maximum|\n",
    "| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n",

    "Some potential issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Values** : Some columns have NA values.\n",
    "- **Outliers** : Extreme values could skew analysis.\n",
    "- **Potential Data Bias** : The sample may not fully represent the broader gaming community.\n",
    "- **Small dataset size** : May lead to overfitting due to only having 196 data points."
